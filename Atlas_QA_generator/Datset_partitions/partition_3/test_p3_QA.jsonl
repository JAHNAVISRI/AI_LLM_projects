{"id": 41, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the purpose of hypothesis testing in linear regression?", "answers": ["Hypothesis testing in linear regression is used to assess whether the predictor variable has a statistically significant relationship with the response variable. It helps determine if the model is a good fit for the data"]}
{"id": 42, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is a confidence interval in linear regression, and how is it related to the coefficients?", "answers": ["A confidence interval is a range of values that estimates the true value of a coefficient with a certain level of confidence. It provides a range within which the true coefficient is likely to fall"]}
{"id": 43, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How does the p-value in linear regression help in hypothesis testing?", "answers": ["The p-value in linear regression indicates the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value suggests that the predictor variable is likely to be significant"]}
{"id": 44, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What role does correlation play in linear regression?", "answers": ["Correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables, and it is related to R2 in linear regression. A high correlation between predictor and response variables suggests a strong linear relationship that can be modeled using linear regression"]}
{"id": 45, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the purpose of multiple linear regression?", "answers": ["Multiple linear regression is used to model the relationship between a response variable and two or more predictor variables."]}
{"id": 46, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How does simple linear regression differ from multiple linear regression?", "answers": ["Simple linear regression involves one predictor variable, while multiple linear regression involves multiple predictor variables."]}
{"id": 47, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why is it problematic to run separate simple linear regressions for each predictor in some cases?", "answers": ["It can lead to difficulties in making overall predictions and can provide misleading estimates if predictors are correlated."]}
{"id": 48, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What do the \u03b2 coefficients represent in multiple linear regression?", "answers": ["The \u03b2 coefficients represent the effect on the response variable for a one-unit increase in each predictor, holding other predictors constant."]}
{"id": 49, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What does the F-statistic test in multiple linear regression?", "answers": ["It tests whether there is a significant relationship between the predictors and the response."]}
{"id": 50, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What are some limitations of using R2 as a measure of model fit?", "answers": ["R2 can increase even when adding irrelevant predictors, and it doesn't account for overfitting."]}
