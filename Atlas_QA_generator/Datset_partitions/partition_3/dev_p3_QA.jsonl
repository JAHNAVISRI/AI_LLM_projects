{"id": 31, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "If a column in a dataset is read as dtype 'object' when it should be numeric, what might be a reason for this?", "answers": ["It could be because some values in the column are non-numeric, such as '?', which might be used to encode missing values."]}
{"id": 32, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How can you specify certain values to be treated as NaN when reading a CSV file in pandas?", "answers": ["You can use the na_values argument in pd.read_csv() and specify the values to be treated as NaN."]}
{"id": 33, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How can you drop rows with missing values from a pandas DataFrame?", "answers": ["You can use the .dropna() method on the DataFrame."]}
{"id": 34, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the purpose of using a lambda function in DataFrame selection?", "answers": ["A lambda function allows for concise functional queries that can filter rows based on certain conditions."]}
{"id": 35, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the primary purpose of linear regression?", "answers": ["Linear regression is primarily used for predicting a quantitative response based on a linear relationship with one or more predictor variables"]}
{"id": 36, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the least squares approach in linear regression?", "answers": ["The least squares approach in linear regression is a method used to find the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values"]}
{"id": 37, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What does the residual sum of squares (RSS) measure in linear regression?", "answers": ["The residual sum of squares (RSS) measures the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values, quantifying the overall model's goodness of fit"]}
{"id": 38, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the RSE in linear regression, and how is it interpreted?", "answers": ["The RSE (Residual Standard Error) measures the average amount by which the actual response values deviate from the regression model's predictions. It quantifies the model's lack of fit"]}
{"id": 39, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the purpose of the F-statistic in linear regression?", "answers": ["The F-statistic assesses the overall significance of the linear regression model by comparing the explained variance to unexplained variance. It helps determine whether the model as a whole is statistically significant"]}
{"id": 40, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How is the R2 statistic calculated, and what does it represent in linear regression?", "answers": ["The R2 statistic is calculated as 1 minus the ratio of the residual sum of squares (RSS) to the total sum of squares (TSS). It represents the proportion of the variance in the response variable explained by the predictor variable"]}
