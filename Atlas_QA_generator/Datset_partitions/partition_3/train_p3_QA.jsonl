{"id": 1, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the primary objective of the Advertising data set study?", "answers": ["The primary objective of the Advertising data set study is to investigate the association between advertising and sales of a product. By understanding this association, the goal is to develop an accurate model to predict sales based on advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspaper."]}
{"id": 2, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What are some other terms used to refer to input variables and output variables in statistical learning?", "answers": ["Input variables are also known as predictors, independent variables, features, or simply variables. The output variable is often called the response or dependent variable."]}
{"id": 3, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What does the error term, denoted as ', represent?", "answers": ["The error term represents random errors or deviations of the observed response values from the true function f. These errors are assumed to be independent of the predictors and have a mean of zero."]}
{"id": 4, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What are the two types of errors that affect the accuracy of Y ?", "answers": ["The two types of errors are the reducible error and the irreducible error."]}
{"id": 5, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why is the irreducible error larger than zero?", "answers": ["The irreducible error is larger than zero because it may contain unmeasured variables that are useful in predicting Y or unmeasurable variation."]}
{"id": 6, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why might linear models be preferred for inference?", "answers": ["Linear models are preferred for inference because they allow for relatively simple and interpretable relationships between predictors and the response."]}
{"id": 7, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the implication of a high irreducible error for our predictions?", "answers": ["The lasso method relies on the linear model but uses an alternative fitting procedure that can set some coefficients to exactly zero, leading to a more interpretable model."]}
{"id": 8, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Describe overfitting?", "answers": ["Overfitting occurs when a statistical method follows the errors or noise too closely, leading to poor predictions on new observations."]}
{"id": 9, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How does the lasso method differ from least squares linear regression?", "answers": ["Odds represent the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to it not occurring."]}
{"id": 10, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why can highly flexible methods lead to overfitting?", "answers": ["Highly flexible methods can lead to overfitting because they might adapt too closely to the training data, including its noise or errors, rather than capturing the underlying relationship."]}
{"id": 11, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "what is the trade-off between prediction accuracy and model interpretability?", "answers": ["As the flexibility of a method increases, its interpretability often decreases."]}
{"id": 12, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What are the two main categories of statistical learning problems?", "answers": ["The two main categories of statistical learning problems are supervised and unsupervised learning."]}
{"id": 13, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "In supervised learning, what is the relationship between predictor measurements and response measurements?", "answers": ["In supervised learning, for each observation of the predictor measurement(s), there is an associated response measurement. The aim is to fit a model that relates the response to the predictors."]}
{"id": 14, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the goal of cluster analysis in unsupervised learning?", "answers": ["The goal of cluster analysis is to ascertain whether the observations fall into relatively distinct groups based on the measurements."]}
{"id": 15, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why are automated clustering methods important when dealing with datasets with many variables?", "answers": ["Automated clustering methods are important because visual inspection is not a viable way to identify clusters in datasets with many variables."]}
{"id": 16, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How are quantitative and qualitative variables distinguished?", "answers": ["Quantitative variables take on numerical values, while qualitative (or categorical) variables take on values in one of K different classes or categories."]}
{"id": 17, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What type of problem deals with a quantitative response, and what type deals with a qualitative response?", "answers": ["Problems with a quantitative response are referred to as regression problems, and those with a qualitative response are referred to as classification problems."]}
{"id": 18, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the main difference between training MSE and test MSE?", "answers": ["Training MSE is computed using the data that was used to fit the model, whereas test MSE measures the accuracy of predictions on previously unseen data."]}
{"id": 19, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why is it problematic to rely solely on the training MSE to evaluate a model's accuracy?", "answers": ["Many statistical methods are specifically designed to minimize the training set MSE. However, a low training MSE doesn't guarantee a low test MSE. Solely relying on the training MSE can lead to overfitting."]}
{"id": 20, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What does 'degrees of freedom' represent in terms of a curve's flexibility?", "answers": ["Degrees of freedom' is a quantity that summarizes the flexibility of a curve. A curve with higher degrees of freedom is more flexible."]}
{"id": 21, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is cross-validation and why is it important?", "answers": ["Cross-validation is a method to estimate the test MSE using the training data. It's important because it provides insight into how a statistical learning method will perform on an independent data set."]}
{"id": 22, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the primary goal of classification?", "answers": ["The goal is to predict qualitative responses by assigning observations to categories or classes."]}
{"id": 23, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What does the U-shape observed in the test MSE curves suggest?", "answers": ["The U-shape suggests the result of two competing properties of statistical learning methods: bias and variance. As the flexibility of a model increases, its bias decreases but its variance increases, leading to a U-shaped curve for the test MSE."]}
{"id": 24, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How does the variance of a statistical learning method relate to its flexibility?", "answers": [" In general, more flexible statistical methods have higher variance. If a method has high variance, then small changes in the training data can result in large changes in the estimated function."]}
{"id": 25, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": " In a real-life scenario, can we directly compute the test MSE, bias, or variance for a statistical learning method?", "answers": ["No, in a real-life situation where the true function is unobserved, it is generally not possible to directly compute the test MSE, bias, or variance. However, techniques like cross-validation can be used to estimate the test MSE using the training data."]}
{"id": 26, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "If you have a numpy array x and want to determine its dimensions, which attribute should you access?", "answers": ["You should access the ndim attribute, for example, x.ndim."]}
{"id": 27, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the method to reshape a numpy array?", "answers": ["The method to reshape a numpy array is reshape(), for instance, x.reshape((2, 3))."]}
{"id": 28, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How can you concatenate the strings 'hello' and 'world' in Python?", "answers": ["You can concatenate them using the addition + symbol: 'hello' + ' ' + 'world'."]}
{"id": 29, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the primary purpose of a data frame in Python?", "answers": ["A data frame can be thought of as a sequence of arrays of identical length, which are the columns. Entries in the different arrays can be combined to form a row. They are used to accommodate datasets that contain different types of data and might have names associated with the rows or columns."]}
{"id": 30, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How can you change the working directory in Python?", "answers": ["You can use the os.chdir() command after importing the os module."]}
