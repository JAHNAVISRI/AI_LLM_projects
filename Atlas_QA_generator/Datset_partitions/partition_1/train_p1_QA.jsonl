{"id": 1, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the primary objective of the Advertising data set study?", "answers": ["The primary objective of the Advertising data set study is to investigate the association between advertising and sales of a product. By understanding this association, the goal is to develop an accurate model to predict sales based on advertising budgets for TV, radio, and newspaper."]}
{"id": 2, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What are some other terms used to refer to input variables and output variables in statistical learning?", "answers": ["Input variables are also known as predictors, independent variables, features, or simply variables. The output variable is often called the response or dependent variable."]}
{"id": 3, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What does the error term, denoted as ', represent?", "answers": ["The error term represents random errors or deviations of the observed response values from the true function f. These errors are assumed to be independent of the predictors and have a mean of zero."]}
{"id": 4, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What are the two types of errors that affect the accuracy of Y ?", "answers": ["The two types of errors are the reducible error and the irreducible error."]}
{"id": 5, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why is the irreducible error larger than zero?", "answers": ["The irreducible error is larger than zero because it may contain unmeasured variables that are useful in predicting Y or unmeasurable variation."]}
{"id": 6, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why might linear models be preferred for inference?", "answers": ["Linear models are preferred for inference because they allow for relatively simple and interpretable relationships between predictors and the response."]}
{"id": 7, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the implication of a high irreducible error for our predictions?", "answers": ["The lasso method relies on the linear model but uses an alternative fitting procedure that can set some coefficients to exactly zero, leading to a more interpretable model."]}
