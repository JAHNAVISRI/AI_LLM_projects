{"id": 18, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the main difference between training MSE and test MSE?", "answers": ["Training MSE is computed using the data that was used to fit the model, whereas test MSE measures the accuracy of predictions on previously unseen data."]}
{"id": 19, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why is it problematic to rely solely on the training MSE to evaluate a model's accuracy?", "answers": ["Many statistical methods are specifically designed to minimize the training set MSE. However, a low training MSE doesn't guarantee a low test MSE. Solely relying on the training MSE can lead to overfitting."]}
{"id": 20, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What does 'degrees of freedom' represent in terms of a curve's flexibility?", "answers": ["Degrees of freedom' is a quantity that summarizes the flexibility of a curve. A curve with higher degrees of freedom is more flexible."]}
