{"id": 81, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How is the Poisson distribution typically used in practice?", "answers": ["The Poisson distribution is used to model counts, especially when counts take on nonnegative integer values."]}
{"id": 82, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What phenomenon is observed when performing regressions with only a single predictor while other predictors may also be relevant?", "answers": ["The phenomenon observed is known as 'confounding,' where results obtained using one predictor may differ significantly from those using multiple predictors, especially with correlated predictors."]}
{"id": 83, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why is the naive Bayes assumption made, even if it's not always believed to be true in most settings?", "answers": ["The naive Bayes assumption introduces some bias but reduces variance, leading to a classifier that often works well in practice due to the bias-variance trade-off."]}
{"id": 84, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "In the LDA method, how is a new observation classified?", "answers": ["In LDA, a new observation is classified by plugging parameter estimates into a formula to obtain quantities, and the observation is assigned to the class for which quantity is largest."]}
{"id": 85, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the significance of the ROC curve in evaluating a classifier's performance?", "answers": ["The ROC curve traces out two types of error as the threshold value for the posterior probability varies, representing the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity)."]}
{"id": 86, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "In the context of classification, what does the 'true positive rate' represent?", "answers": ["The true positive rate, also known as sensitivity, represents the fraction of actual positives (e.g., defaulters) that are correctly identified using a given threshold value."]}
{"id": 87, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the significance of the threshold in the Bayes classifier?", "answers": ["The threshold determines the posterior probability required to assign an observation to a particular class."]}
{"id": 88, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the primary goal of classification?", "answers": ["The goal is to predict qualitative responses by assigning observations to categories or classes."]}
{"id": 89, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the significance of the p-value associated with a predictor in a logistic regression table?", "answers": ["The p-value tests the null hypothesis that the predictor's coefficient is zero, implying no association with the response. A small p-value indicates a significant association."]}
{"id": 90, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How is the posterior probability calculated in the context of the naive Bayes classifier?", "answers": ["The posterior probability is computed using the product of the prior probability and the one-dimensional density functions for each predictor, normalized over all classes."]}
{"id": 91, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "When might neither linear regression nor the classification approaches be applicable for a response variable?", "answers": ["When the response variable is neither qualitative nor quantitative, such as when it takes on non-negative integer values or counts, neither linear regression nor typical classification approaches may be suitable."]}
{"id": 92, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the significance of the Bayes' theorem in classification?", "answers": ["Bayes' theorem provides an expression for the posterior probability in terms of prior probabilities and density functions, allowing for the classification of observations into one of multiple classes."]}
{"id": 93, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How is the prior probability, denoted as, typically estimated for a class?", "answers": ["The prior probability can be estimated as the proportion of training observations belonging to the kth class."]}
{"id": 94, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How does LDA assign a new observation?", "answers": ["LDA plugs in estimates for the parameters into the discriminant function and classifies the observation to the class for which the discriminant value is largest."]}
{"id": 95, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How do the Bayes decision boundaries divide the predictor space when there are multiple classes?", "answers": ["The Bayes decision boundaries divide the predictor space into regions, and an observation is classified according to the region in which it is located."]}
{"id": 96, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the significance of the ROC curve in evaluating the performance of a classifier?", "answers": ["The ROC curve traces out two types of error as the threshold value for the posterior probability varies, representing the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate."]}
{"id": 97, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the relationship between LDA, QDA, and naive Bayes?", "answers": ["LDA, QDA, and naive Bayes classifiers are developed using Bayes' theorem. LDA is a special case of QDA, and any classifier with a linear decision boundary is a special case of naive Bayes."]}
{"id": 98, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "How does the Bayes decision boundary change when considering the correlations mentioned?", "answers": ["Given the correlations, the Bayes decision boundary becomes quadratic, making QDA a more accurate approximation than LDA for this boundary."]}
{"id": 99, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "Why is naive Bayes considered a good choice in many settings, especially when n is not large relative to p?", "answers": ["Naive Bayes is effective because estimating a joint distribution requires a large amount of data. The naive Bayes assumption reduces variance, making it suitable for smaller datasets relative to the number of predictors."]}
{"id": 100, "contributed_by": "group 1", "question": "What is the relationship between LDA and QDA in terms of their mathematical formulations?", "answers": ["LDA is a special case of QDA with certain coefficients set to zero. Specifically, LDA is a restricted version of QDA where all classes share the same covariance matrix."]}
