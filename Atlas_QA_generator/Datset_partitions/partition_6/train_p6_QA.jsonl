{"id": 111, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How is the LOOCV estimate for the test MSE calculated?", "answers": ["The LOOCV estimate for the test MSE is the average of these n test error estimates: CV(n) = 1/n0ni=1MSEi."]}
{"id": 112, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What advantages does LOOCV have over the validation set approach?", "answers": ["LOOCV has a couple of major advantages over the validation set approach. First, it has far less bias. In LOOCV, we repeatedly fit the statistical learning method using training sets that contain n - 1 observations, almost as many as are in the entire data set. Second, in contrast to the validation approach which will yield different results when applied repeatedly due to randomness in the training/validation set splits, performing LOOCV multiple times will always yield the same results: there is no randomness in the training/validation set splits."]}
{"id": 113, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is k-fold cross-validation (CV) and how does it differ from LOOCV?", "answers": ["k-fold CV involves dividing the set of observations into k groups of approximately equal size. In each iteration, one of these groups is treated as a validation set, and the method is fitted on the remaining k - 1 groups. This process is repeated k times, and k estimates of the test error are computed. LOOCV is a special case of k-fold CV where k equals n (the number of observations)."]}
{"id": 114, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the advantage of using k = 5 or k = 10 in k-fold cross-validation over k = n?", "answers": ["Using k = 5 or k = 10 in k-fold cross-validation has the advantage of being computationally less expensive than using k = n. LOOCV, with k = n, requires fitting the statistical learning method n times, which can be computationally expensive. However, cross-validation can be applied to almost any statistical learning method, some of which have computationally intensive fitting procedures. Using k = 5 or k = 10, you only need to fit the learning procedure ten times, which is more feasible. It also has non-computational advantages related to the bias-variance trade-off."]}
{"id": 115, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the bias-variance trade-off associated with the choice of k in k-fold cross-validation?", "answers": ["The choice of k in k-fold cross-validation involves a bias-variance trade-off. Using k < n leads to a lower level of bias compared to LOOCV, as each training set contains approximately (k - 1)n/k observations. However, it also results in lower variance compared to LOOCV since the outputs of the fitted models are less correlated due to smaller overlap between training sets in each model."]}
{"id": 116, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does k-fold cross-validation compare to LOOCV in terms of variance?", "answers": ["k-fold cross-validation tends to have lower variance compared to LOOCV. This is because when using LOOCV, the outputs of n fitted models are highly correlated, while in k-fold CV with k < n, the outputs are less correlated due to smaller overlap between training sets in each model. The mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than the mean of many quantities that are not as highly correlated."]}
{"id": 117, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "In what situations is LOOCV preferred over k-fold cross-validation?", "answers": ["LOOCV is preferred over k-fold cross-validation when bias reduction is a primary concern. LOOCV tends to provide approximately unbiased estimates of the test error rate because each training set in LOOCV contains n - 1 observations, which is nearly as many as the number of observations in the full data set."]}

{"id": 119, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What are the situations where the actual value of the estimated test MSE is important in cross-validation?", "answers": ["The actual value of the estimated test MSE is important in cross-validation when the primary goal is to determine how well a given statistical learning procedure can be expected to perform on independent data. In this case, the accuracy of the test MSE estimate is of interest."]}
{"id": 120, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the potential disadvantage of the validation set approach?", "answers": ["The validation set approach can lead to overestimates of the test error rate since the training set used to fit the statistical learning method contains only half the observations of the entire data set."]}
{"id": 121, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Why is LOOCV considered to provide approximately unbiased estimates of the test error rate?", "answers": ["LOOCV provides approximately unbiased estimates of the test error rate because each training set in LOOCV contains n - 1 observations, which is nearly as many as the number of observations in the full data set."]}

{"id": 123, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How is cross-validation applied in the classification setting?", "answers": ["In the classification setting, cross-validation is applied similarly to the regression setting, but instead of using mean squared error (MSE) to quantify test error, the number of misclassified observations is used. The LOOCV error rate, k-fold CV error rate, and validation set error rates are defined based on the number of misclassified observations."]}
{"id": 124, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "In the classification setting, how is the LOOCV error rate defined?", "answers": ["In the classification setting, the LOOCV error rate is defined as the average number of misclassified observations.

{"id": 131, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How is the validation set approach used to estimate test error rates?", "answers": ["The validation set approach is used by splitting the data into training and validation sets.

{"id": 138, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is subset selection?", "answers": ["Subset selection involves identifying a subset of the 'p' predictors that we believe to be related to the response. We then fit a model using least squares on the reduced set of variables."]}
{"id": 139, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does shrinkage have the effect of reducing variance?", "answers": ["Shrinkage involves fitting a model involving all 'p' predictors. However, the estimated coefficients are shrunken towards zero relative to the least squares estimates. Thus shrinkage (also known as regularization) has the effect of reducing variance."]}
{"id": 140, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How is dimension reduction used as an alternative method to fit linear models?", "answers": ["Dimension reduction involves projecting the 'p' predictors into an M-dimensional subspace, where M is lesser than 'p'. This is achieved by computing M different linear combinations, or projections, of the variables. Then these M projections are used as predictors to fit a linear regression model by least squares."]}
{"id": 141, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How do you perform best subset selection?", "answers": ["To perform best subset selection, we fit a separate least squares regression for each possible combination of the 'p' predictors.

We then look at all of the resulting models, with the goal of identifying the one that is best."]}
{"id": 142, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the drawback of best subset selection?", "answers": ["For computational reasons, best subset selection cannot be applied with very large 'p' predictors. It may also suffer from statistical problems when 'p' is large. The larger the search space, the higher the chance of finding models that look good on the training data, even though they might not have any predictive power on future data.

{"id": 144, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is forward stepwise selection?", "answers": ["Forward stepwise selection is a computationally efficient alternative to best subset selection. It begins with a model containing no predictors, and then adds predictors to the model, one-at-a-time, until all of the predictors are in the model. In particular, at each step the variable that gives the greatest additional improvement to the fit is added to the model."]}
{"id": 145, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Explain one way how backward stepwise selection is different from forward stepwise selection?", "answers": ["Unlike forward stepwise selection, backward stepwise begins with the least full squares model containing all 'p' predictors, and then iteratively removes the least useful predictor, one-at-a-time."]}
{"id": 146, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What are the two approaches to selecting the best model with respect to test error?", "answers": ["The first approach is that we can indirectly estimate test error by making an adjustment to the training error to account for the bias due to overfitting.

{"id": 116, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does k-fold cross-validation compare to LOOCV in terms of variance?", "answers": ["k-fold cross-validation tends to have lower variance compared to LOOCV.

{"id": 149, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does the adjusted R2 differ from Cp, AIC, and BIC in model selection?", "answers": ["Adjusted R2 is a statistic used for model selection, and it differs from Cp, AIC, and BIC in that a larger value of adjusted R2 indicates a model with lower test error. The model with the largest adjusted R squared will have only correct variables and no noise variables."]}
{"id": 150, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and what is its role in model selection?", "answers": ["Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is derived from a Bayesian perspective and is used in model selection. BIC places a heavier penalty on models with many variables compared to Cp and AIC, resulting in the selection of smaller models."]}
{"id": 151, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does ridge regression improve over least squares?", "answers": ["The advantage of Ridge regression is rooted in the bias-variance trade-off. As lambda increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases, leading to decreased variance but increased bias."]}
{"id": 152, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How is the one-standard-error rule used in model selection with validation sets and cross-validation?", "answers": ["The one-standard-error rule is used to select a model when multiple models have similar estimated test errors. It involves calculating the standard error of the estimated test mean squared error (MSE) for each model size. Then, the model with the lowest estimated test error within one standard error of the lowest point on the curve is selected. This rule helps choose a simpler model if several models are equally good."]}
{"id": 153, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What are the advantages of using validation sets and cross-validation for model selection?", "answers": ["Using validation sets and cross-validation for model selection offers the advantage of providing a direct estimate of test error, making fewer assumptions about the true underlying model. These approaches can be applied in a wider range of model selection tasks, even when it's challenging to determine the model degrees of freedom or estimate error variance."]}
{"id": 154, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Why is it recommended to standardize predictors before applying ridge regression?", "answers": ["Standardizing predictors before ridge regression is recommended to ensure that all predictors are on the same scale. Ridge regression coefficients can be influenced by the scaling of predictors, and the final fit may depend on the scaling of other predictors as well. Standardizing predictors to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one makes the ridge regression results independent of the scale of the predictors."]}
{"id": 155, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "When would ridge regression not be the suitable regression method to apply?", "answers": ["Ridge regression includes all 'p' predictors in the final model. The penalty will shrink all of the coefficients towards zero, but it will not set any of them exactly to zero (unless lambda equals to infinity). This may not be a problem for prediction accuracy, but it can create a challenge in model interpretation in settings in which the number of variables 'p' is quite large."]}
{"id": 156, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does lasso overcome the disadvantage of ridge regression?", "answers": ["The lasso uses an l1 penalty instead of l2. The lasso shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. However, the l1 penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero when the tuning parameter lambda is sufficiently large. Therefore, the lasso performs variable selection. As a result, models generated from the lasso are generally much easier to interpret than those produced by ridge regression."]}
{"id": 157, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Which method between lasso and ridge is better?", "answers": ["In general, one might expect the lasso to perform better in a setting where a relatively small number of predictors have substantial coefficients, and the remaining predictors have coefficients that are very small or that equal zero. Ridge regression will perform better when the response is a function of many predictors, all with coefficients of roughly equal size. However, the number of predictors that is related to the response is never known a priori for real data sets. A technique such as cross-validation can be used in order to determine which approach is better on a particular data set."]}
{"id": 158, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What distinguishes Partial Least Squares (PLS) from Principal Components Regression (PCR)?", "answers": ["Unlike PCR, which identifies principal components in an unsupervised manner, PLS is a supervised dimension reduction method. It considers both the predictors and the response variable to identify directions (components) that not only explain the predictors well but also have a strong relationship with the response."]}
{"id": 159, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Does PCR perform feature selection?", "answers": ["No, PCR does not perform feature selection. This is because each of the M principal components used in the regression is a linear combination of all p of the original features. Therefore, while PCR often performs quite well in many practical settings, it does not result in the development of a model that relies upon a small set of the original features."]}
{"id": 160, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Why has there been a shift in data collection methods over the past two decades?", "answers": ["Advances in technology have enabled the collection of data with a large number of features, leading to scenarios where the number of features is large compared to the number of observations."]}
{"id": 161, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What happens when traditional statistical techniques like ordinary least squares (OLS) regression are applied to high-dimensional data?", "answers": ["Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression may result in a perfect fit to the training data, but it often performs poorly on new unseen data leading to overfitting."]}
{"id": 162, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does the curse of dimensionality relate to high-dimensional data analysis?", "answers": ["The curse of dimensionality refers to the challenge of dealing with high-dimensional data where increasing the number of features, especially irrelevant ones, can lead to a significant increase in the risk of overfitting, potentially degrading the model's performance."]}
{"id": 163, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "In the context of high-dimensional data analysis, why is it difficult to identify the best variables and coefficients for a regression model?", "answers": ["In high dimensions, multicollinearity is extreme, making it challenging to determine which variables are truly predictive. Any variable in the model can be expressed as a linear combination of all other variables, making it difficult to pinpoint the best coefficients or predictors."]}
{"id": 164, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does lasso perform feature selection?", "answers": ["The lasso shrinks each least squares coefficient towards zero by a constant amount i.e. by lambda divided by 2. The least squares coefficients that are less than lambda divided by 2 in absolute value are shrunken entirely to zero. The fact that some lasso coefficients are shrunken entirely to zero explains how the lasso performs feature selection."]}
{"id": 165, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How do ridge regression and the lasso relate to a Bayesian viewpoint of regression?", "answers": ["Ridge regression and the lasso can be viewed through a Bayesian lens. Ridge regression corresponds to a Gaussian prior on the coefficient vector, while the lasso corresponds to a double-exponential (Laplace) prior. In Bayesian terms, the solutions provided by ridge regression and the lasso are the posterior modes of the coefficient vector, reflecting the most likely values for the coefficient vector beta given the data."]}
{"id": 166, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What does it mean when the lasso prior is described as steeply peaked at zero?", "answers": ["The lasso prior having a peak at zero indicates that it expects many coefficients to be exactly zero."]}
{"id": 167, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the computational advantage of ridge regression over best subset selection?", "answers": ["Even for moderate values for p, the search can be computationally infeasible in best subset selection. In contrast, for any fixed value of lambda, ridge regression only fits a single model, and the model fitting procedure can be performed quite quickly."]}
{"id": 168, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What are the main limitations of standard linear regression?", "answers": ["The main limitations of standard linear regression include its assumption of linearity, which can be a poor approximation in many real-world scenarios, and its inability to capture complex non-linear relationships between predictors and the response variable."]}
{"id": 169, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does polynomial regression extend the linear model, and what does it involve?", "answers": ["Polynomial regression extends the linear model by including additional predictor variables, obtained by raising the original predictors to various powers. For instance, a cubic regression includes variables X, X squared, and X cube. This approach provides a way to model non-linear relationships between predictors and the response."]}
{"id": 170, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the purpose of step functions in regression modeling, and how do they affect the model's output?", "answers": ["Step functions in regression modeling are used to partition the range of a variable into distinct regions, effectively transforming it into a qualitative variable. This results in a piecewise constant function, allowing the model to capture abrupt changes in the relationship between predictors and the response."]}
{"id": 171, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How do regression splines differ from polynomial regression, and what advantage do they offer in modeling non-linear relationships?", "answers": ["Regression splines are more flexible than polynomial regression and involve dividing the predictor range into distinct regions. Within each region, a polynomial function is fitted to the data, but these polynomials are constrained to join smoothly at region boundaries or knots. This approach offers greater flexibility and can model non-linear relationships without the excessive flexibility seen in high-degree polynomial regression."]}
{"id": 172, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Why is it unusual to use a high degree of polynomial terms in polynomial regression, and what issues can arise with overly flexible polynomial curves?", "answers": ["It is unusual to use a high degree of polynomial terms in polynomial regression because as d increases, the polynomial curve becomes overly flexible. This flexibility can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise in the data rather than true relationships. Additionally, near the boundary of predictor variables, high-degree polynomials can produce erratic and undesirable shapes, making interpretation and generalization challenging."]}
{"id": 173, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the key strength of generalized additive models (GAMs) in comparison to linear models when it comes to multivariate regression?", "answers": ["The primary strength of generalized additive models (GAMs) lies in their ability to fit multivariate regression models with more flexibility than linear models."]}
{"id": 174, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How is a GAM model constructed by hand for predicting wage, and which predictor variables are involved in this manual approach?", "answers": ["In the manual construction of a GAM for predicting wage, natural spline functions of year and age are used as predictor variables. Education is treated as a qualitative predictor in this model."]}
{"id": 175, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Why is it necessary to build the model matrix manually when fitting a GAM, and what is the purpose of doing so in the context of constructing partial dependence plots?", "answers": ["Building the model matrix manually is important because it allows access to the individual components of the model. This manual approach is chosen to gain control and insight into the model's components when constructing partial dependence plots."]}
{"id": 176, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the purpose of local regression, and how does it differ from other regression methods?", "answers": ["Local regression is a different approach for fitting flexible non-linear functions that compute the fit at a target point using nearby training observations. It differs from other regression methods in that it focuses on local data points to estimate the function."]}
{"id": 177, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "How does local regression use weights in the modeling process, and why are these weights unique for each value of x0?", "answers": ["Local regression uses weights (Ki0) to fit a new weighted least squares regression model at each point (x0). These weights are unique for each x0 because they are based on the nearby data points, and they need to be recalculated for each new point."]}
{"id": 178, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "Why is local regression sometimes referred to as a memory-based procedure, and what does it have in common with nearest-neighbors?", "answers": ["Local regression is called a memory-based procedure because, like nearest-neighbors, it requires all the training data each time it computes a prediction. Both methods rely on the entire dataset for predictions."]}
{"id": 179, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "What is the most crucial choice to make when performing local regression, and how does the 'span' parameter affect the process?", "answers": ["The most important choice in local regression is the 'span' (s), which determines the proportion of points used to compute the local regression at a specific point (x0). The span is similar to a tuning parameter and significantly influences the outcome of the local regression."]}
{"id": 180, "contributed_by": "group 2", "question": "When fitting a spline, what determines the flexibility of a regression spline, and how does knot placement influence this flexibility?", "answers": ["The flexibility of a regression spline is determined by the number and placement of knots. In regions with more knots, the polynomial coefficients can change rapidly, making the spline more flexible. Therefore, knot placement plays a crucial role in controlling the flexibility of the spline. Placing more knots in regions where rapid function changes are expected and fewer knots in stable regions is one option."]}
